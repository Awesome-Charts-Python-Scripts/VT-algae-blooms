# VT-algae-blooms
CS 5540 class project to use machine learning techniques to predict algae blooms in Vermont

### Team

### Project
 
We will develop a machine learning model that will predict algae blooms in selected bodies of water in Vermont. The data set we will be using comes from the [Vermont Cyanobacteria Tracker](https://www.healthvermont.gov/environment/tracking/cyanobacteria-blue-green-algae-tracker) from the Vermont Department of Health, and we will combine that data with weather information from the National Weather Service. Potential research questions include:
 
- Is it possible to predict when a bloom will happen?
- Is it possible to predict characteristics of algae blooms (e.g. their size, duration, toxicity)?
 
### Tasks
 
- Acquire the data
  - Algae blooms
  - Weather
- Explore the data
  - Create test & cross-validation sets
  - Create categorical attributes and quantitative variables
- Prepare for machine learning algorithms
  - Clean the data
  - Prepare text and categorical attributes (e.g. one-hot encoding if necessary)
  - Feature scaling & transformation (e.g. standardize maximums & minimums; normalize attributes)
- Select & train on model(s)
  - Test & evaluate on training set (we will each try a different model)
  - Do cross-validation
  - Feature selection
- Fine-tune the model(s)
  - Evaluate on test set
- Write project report & presentation
