There are specks of cyanobacteria throughout the water but there is no obvious bloom at sampling area (see important note). Close up photo 3 is in a shadow to show the specks of cyanobacteria floating in the water. IMPORTANT NOTE: I like to take a quick look at the boat launch area when sampling, which is about 200 feet away from the Outing Club dock where jar sample is taken. The wind was blowing from the north east and it appears that some of the clusters of cyanobacteria accumulated right at the area of the boat launch  (could be a coincidence, maybe it wasn't due to wind at all). The close up photos 1 and 2 show where it accumulated. Would this be considered a bloom? You can see how it compares to my hand, its not a very large area. Close up photo 2 shows what I think to be a Dolichospermum sp. based on Peter's previous advice. I am unsure what is in close up photo 1 but it appeared to have oxygen bubbles surrounding it, unlike the Dolicospermum photo. That small section of shoreline may be in the 2 category, but I am unsure as it differed greatly from my jar sampling location. I did not survey the rest of the shoreline/lake. Please inform me if you'd like me to make a separate report for that section and please let me know what you think is going on in those closeup photos.

Also, though difficult to pick out in the photos, I can see spots on the water surface (dispersed & fine greenish patches 1 to 4 ft wide). FYI - The wind is pushing the water into the bay and towards the south end. It is possible the bloom has shifted position or may be dissipating.  Little evidence of the cyan west of the bridge.

There are some spotty (dozens of smallish - estimate most are hand to lower arm length length) patches on the railroad shoreline. Recently, the water level has dropped. So some patches area above water level or on floating material.  The water itself appears relatively and in a few isolate areas mildly turbid. There are what appear to be degraded patches less than hand size floating under the bridge into the main body of the lake. Sometimes there are blue-green clouds with the break-up of the material.

Ventured that way to see what’s going on. Of course, that is when the wind shifted! Did get close to see areas still with collection of fine browns, grays and tiny white flower parts. Followed the surface both west and north along Indian Point and along south shore of Bluffside beach eastward. Also around Prouty west side and the most western part of the active south beach. The only place of observed some modest cyan (cat2) mixed in was the easterly area along Bluffside SOUTH beach near the emergent vegetation. For distance of 40ft, some offshore and some collected near the veg at the shore.  Green surface irregular distribution - some 1ft to the most concentrated against eastern emergent plant edge of 10ft wide.",,Calm,,,,,,,,44.94916122,-72.21252973

Visually I think is assesses as cat1d? This morning had to wait for intense rain storm to move through the area. The winds shifted much of the near shore materials and washed some ashore. Some brownish foamy scum was observed in small patches along the west and south beaches. Observed NO green surface scum. Sample grabs from both shores were dominated by ephippia (resting eggs). Microscopically did not see the vast and many species of cyano evident in the samples from 20220912. There still may be some minor presence of one species. Refer to micro-2. Possible to step over or around material at shore. The area smells like sewage or decaying stepped in poo…  Had to clean off the muck on my boots!,,White Caps,,,,,,,,44.94913084,-72.21319492

I am not able to sample that material but based on other observations along the south end of the lake, it looks similar to what I could take a closer look at at Newport Marina and Newport City Dock. No sign of surface green accumulations or tinted water. or even greenish scum along the shore. Clarity some what impacted by recent stormwater but still can see the submerged veg.

Not sure if you still want it.  Last Sunday 10/23 at 3:30pm, kayaking from the iron railroad bridge across Carry Bay north, I started encountering some cyanobacteria at the iron bridge, and more along my path north of there for a ways (.3-.5 miles?).  I was 50 to 100 yds off shore.  I think it was a bad 1d, some on the surface but no significant streaking.  It's hard to tell in the middle of the lake without the shore to concentrate what is there.  Pictures have gps in file names.  These pictures were a little north of the iron bridge but it continued north of there.  Could be a 2 but I think you'll probably say 1d.",,Calm,,,,,,,,44.84431105,-73.2971511
